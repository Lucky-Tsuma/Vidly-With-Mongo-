Review on basic express.<br />
Practice CRUD operations with the express framework.<br />
Also handled input validation using the **joi** library.<br />

Touched on middleware as well: custom,  in-built(express.json(), express.urlencoded([options]), express.static()), and third party(such as morgan and helmet)<br />
Practice on configuration using the configuration module(basically how we would override different settinggs for different environments(dev, testing, prod, live))<br />
